Colors
=================
Colors is a tiny game I'm working on which is all about quick reflexes.
You are presented with a colour and you are meant to match it with the 4 colour options below.
It's all about time, you only have a limited time to make your selection and once you get it wrong,
you lose.

Currently I'm creating a responsive HTML5 version of the game using Canvas and I'm planning
on exporting this to Android later on.

Demo
=================
Playable demo of the most up-to-date version of the game is available here: http://jakubslaby.net/colors/
